Uses the ebmstats node module on both the client (via Browserify) and the server (via Express) to perform EBM calculations. Will eventually replace the Stats Calculator and OR to NNT Converter found on the Centre for [Evidence-Based Medicine Toronto](http://ktclearinghouse.ca/cebm/toolbox/) website.
